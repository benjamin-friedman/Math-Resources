# Math-Resources
Contains helpful resources for Calculus and Discrete Math.

**Note**
- It may be preferable to download the document PDFs and view the downloaded PDFs directly instead of viewing them on GitHub. When viewing the documents on GitHub it's possible that some of the content will not display very clearly. For example, the equal sign "=" might look like the subtraction operator "-".
- If viewing the documents directly on GitHub, then a *load more pages* button will have to be clicked as the pages are gone through. Sometimes, after clicking this button the pages won't load. In this case, the screen has to be clicked again around the same area for a second time in order for the pages to load.
