**Note**
- It's preferable to download the document PDFs and view the PDFs directly instead of viewing them on GitHub. Generally speaking, they are easier to view this way. Additionally, when viewing the documents on GitHub, it's been noticed that some of the content will not display very clearly. For example,  the equal sign "=" might look like the subtraction operator "-" in some circumstances.
- If viewing the documents directly on GitHub then sometimes the pages can get stuck loading when scrolling down. Sometimes there will be a spinning icon that will get stuck. In that case, click the area right where the spinning icon is to load them. Other times there will be a *load more pages* button that must be clicked and after clicking it the button goes way but the pages don't load. In that case, click that same area where the button was once again in order to load the pages.
